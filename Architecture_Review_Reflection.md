# Architecture Review Reflection
March 29, 2017

## Feedback and Decisions

Overall, our technical review went pretty well. We were able to successfully explain our project to the reviewers allowing them to better understand it and give appropriate feedback. What we came in hoping to find help on, unfortunately, was beyond the scope of the student reviewers, so we weren't able to elicit any advice from them. This, however, turned out to be a learning experience for our team as well as the other team since they instructor team was able to teach us in a new topic area for both teams.

Based off the very helpful feedback, we are probably going to move forward with a mySQL database to use for the app. We weren't really aware of how they worked, but now that we understand that they work sort of like Excel spreadsheets, they can provide much more usability for our project. Obviously we are going to need to do some more research about them, but they are very commonly referenced in flask documentation, so we are confident that there will be adequate documentation for it.

Obviously moving forward there is some uncertainty since we have to learn some of a new language and we don't really know how difficult it is. There is also some concern in the amount of Python in our project since it is very Flask heavy. Obviously Flask requires a lot of HTML (and CSS), it also provides some powerful logic, we just need to think of ways to implement it. Our current thinking is that a lot of it will come from the login process which will have to interact with out server. A lot of logic will also be required to do the data processing and calculations for visualization. As a stretch goal, we would love to add some ML to our visualizations to provide insights for future purchasing and data trends.

## Review Process Reflection

As mentioned before, the review went well and our idea was portrayed well to the team. Also as mentioned before, our questions were a little beyond the scope of the students' understanding of Python, but this proved to be a good learning chance for both teams. Overall, the trajectory of our project is much the same, with the addition of the mySQL implementation.

Next time, we could be more effective by preparing a bit more ahead of time and prepare some visuals to help aid in our explanations as well as add some structure to our presentation. We should also go in with a more realistic idea of our audience that we are presenting to remembering that this is an introductory software design class and most people do not have advanced knowledge especially in data structures and databases.
